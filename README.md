# Weather Forecast App

This is a simple Python application that fetches real-time weather data for a user-specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather conditions. Users can also save their favorite locations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests
- tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WeatherForecastApp.git
   cd WeatherForecastApp
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Replace `your_openweathermap_api_key` in `weather_app.py` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

```bash
python weather_app.py
